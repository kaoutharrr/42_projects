# 42 Common Core – Selected Projects

Some projects I've worked on during my **42 common core**, using **C** and **C++**.  
This repository collects the main projects I completed, reorganized into a single monorepo for clarity.

## 📦 Included Projects

### 🔹 **pool/**
My early C exercises from the 42 Piscine.  
C basics, algorithms, functions, pointers, and problem-solving.

### 🔹 **push_swap/**
A sorting algorithm challenge using two stacks and limited operations.  
Focus: algorithmic complexity, stack operations, and optimization.

### 🔹 **so_long/**
A small 2D game built with MiniLibX.  
Focus: graphics, events, memory management, and map parsing.

### 🔹 **philosophers/**
Implementation of the dining philosophers problem.  
Focus: threads, mutexes, timing, and race conditions.

### 🔹 **minishell/**
A functional shell implementing basic Unix commands.  
Focus: parsing, processes, pipes, redirections, environment, signals.

### 🔹 **cub3d/**
A ray-casting engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.  
Focus: graphics, math, raycasting, player movement, and textures.

### 🔹 **inception/**
A Docker-based infrastructure using multiple containers.  
Focus: Docker, services, Nginx, WordPress, MariaDB, automation.

### 🔹 **cpp-modules/**
C++ programming modules covering fundamental to advanced concepts.  
**cpp00-cpp04**: Classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism  
**cpp05-cpp09**: Exceptions, casting, templates, STL containers and algorithms
